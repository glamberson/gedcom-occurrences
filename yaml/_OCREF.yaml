standard tag: _OCREF

specification:
  - Occurrence Reference
  - |
    An _OCREF structure creates a reference from an individual or family
    to an occurrence record (_OCUR). This allows people to indicate
    their participation in shared occurrences.
    
    The payload is a pointer to the _OCUR record. The substructures can
    provide participant-specific information that may differ from or
    supplement the information in the _OCUR._PART structure.
    
    When both _OCREF and _OCUR._PART contain the same type of
    information (such as ROLE or AGE), the _OCREF takes precedence
    as it represents the perspective of the individual/family.
