standard tag: _PART

specification:
  - Occurrence Participant
  - |
    A _PART structure identifies a participant in an occurrence (_OCUR).
    
    The payload is a pointer to either an individual (INDI) or family (FAM)
    record that participated in the occurrence.
    
    In the container-only model, _PART serves only as a participant manifest.
    All participant-specific data (role, age, notes, sources) should be
    stored in the corresponding _OCREF structure in the individual or
    family record.
